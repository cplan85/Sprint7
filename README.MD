# Sprint 7 - Budget App

The Sprint 7 - Budget App is an Angular application that allows users to develop simple web services budgets and then dynamically display that information through charts and figures. The user is then able to save the Budgets through local storage, and upon reloading all the saved budgets remain available to the user. As a final functionality, a user is able to filter through their saved budgets based by the budget's name.

## :wrench: **Tech used in this project**

In this project I used Angular with Angular Materials Libraries components to develop a web app that allows users to save their budgets. In this app several services are used to update the total amount.

## :mortar_board: **What did I learn from this project**

In this project I learned how to use, and how to implement filtering processes through string search and toggling tags. These filtering processes were developed in separate components with data shared through Angular services.
Also due to the breadth of the Pokemon APIs with a large hierarchy of nested objects, I learned how to break down the accessing of information, and to logically create intermittent API calls once an earlier API call finished.

## :memo: **What do I still need to do**

1. Load additional Pokemon card through bottom "Load More Pokemons" button or implementing infinite scrolling.

2. Global search function that allows user to search all possible Pokemons rather than just the loaded Pokemons.

3. Implement unit tests to ensure filtering function works exactly as intended.

4. Additional styling to cards.

5. Refactor the code.
